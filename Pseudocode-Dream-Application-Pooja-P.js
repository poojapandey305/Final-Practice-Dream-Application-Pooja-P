//Pseudocode for building the drinking water reminder app in every 2 hours  everyday.

 
// 1.Declare variable 'userName' to store the user's name

//calculate the timeduration in miliseconds 

// Define reminder interval (in milliseconds, 2 hours)

//2.Construct reminder message by combining "Hey " + userName + ", it's time to drink water!"
  
//notes- code related to these steps are demonstrated in project.js file.
